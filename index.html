--=== TITANIC DODGE! ===--

WASD or arrow keys to move. Avoid the titanics and see if you can change the fate of the RMS Iceberg.
The titanics can be harder to see at night, so steer clear!

This game is mobile friendly, just turn on mobile mode in settings :)

Thanks <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/NickNackTheTitaniac">@NickNackTheTitaniac (scratch.mit.edu)</a> for the art
Thanks <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/NickNackTheTitaniac">@NickNackTheTitaniac (scratch.mit.edu)</a> for literally everything except the things listed below:
What I changed:
1. I put a huge red "X" over the "Iceberg" in the title 
2. Below the huge red "X" I put "titanic"
3. In the game I replaced the icebergs with titanics and the player is now an iceberg
4. When you lose the game, it displays a message saying: "You hit an Titanic" and there is a huge iceberg covering the sinking titanic
